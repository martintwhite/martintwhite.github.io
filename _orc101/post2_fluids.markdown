title:  "2. What is a working fluid?"

In the first section of ORC-101, the concept of a thermal power system was introduced. Within such a system, four distinct processes are coupled together to form a closed-loop thermal power system, as shown below.

The term *working fluid* refers to the fluid that undergoes each of these processes in turn to form the complete closed-loop system. The term *working* implies that the energy of the fluid is changing as it moves through the system, whilst the term *fluid* refers to it being in either a liquid or vapour state. Thus, if a thermal power system operated with air, meaning that a certain amount of air underwent the four processes of compression, heating, expansion and cooling in turn, the working fluid would be air. Similarly, if a thermal power system operated with water, meaning that a certain amount of water underwent the same processes in turn, the working fluid would be water.

A final example would the fluid contained within your fridge. You may be familiar with the term *refrigerant* to describe the fluids used within domestic fridges, but what is the purpose of this refrigerant? Essentially, the operating principle of a fridge is the reverse of a thermal power system (more on this in a later post perhaps...). More specifically, within a refrigerator, a fluid, in this case a refrigerant, undergoes a series of processes within a closed-loop system which has the net effect of providing a cooling effect. Thus, in this case, the refrigerant is referred to as the working fluid.
