The aim of this section is to provide interested readers with a basic introduction to some of the key scientific concepts behind my research. It is not intended as a highly-technical section, but instead is aimed at those readers who may not have a technical background but want to understand a little more about the world of thermal power systems.

If you are interested and have any additional questions not covered in this section, have any feedback on the content of this section or suggestions for future content, please feel free to get in touch.
