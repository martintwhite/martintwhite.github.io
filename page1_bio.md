    	<p>I obtained a Masters of Engineering (MEng) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Southampton in 2011, with a specialisation into sustainable energy systems. After a brief spell in industry, I decided to pursue a career in research, graduating with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from City, University of London in October 2015. My PhD investigated the design and analysis of small-scale radial turbines for low-temperature organic Rankine cycles. After this I spent one year working as a Research Associate at Imperial College London within the Clean Energy Processes Laboratory, before returning to City to work on an EPSRC funded project continuing research into expander technologies for organic Rankine cycle power systems. In September 2019, I was awarded a five-year Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship, investigating next generation waste-heat recovery systems, and subsequently was appointed a Lecturer in Thermal Power. In September 2022, I joined the University of Sussex as a Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering and a member of the Thermo-Fluid Mechanics Reseach Centre (TFMRC).</p>

As a researcher my primary focus is on the development of small-scale energy systems suitable for the power generation from low- and medium-temperature heat sources, which includes solar, biomass, geothermal and waste heat. This encompasses system design, simulation and optimisation, working-fluid selection and component design and development, with significant focus on turbomachinery components. Take a look at the research page on this site for more information.

Outside of research, I enjoy getting involved with teaching as much as possible and am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy alongside being a STEM Ambassador.
