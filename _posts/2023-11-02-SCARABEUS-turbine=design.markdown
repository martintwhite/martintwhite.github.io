This latest paper was led by one of the PhD students that I co-supervise at City, University of London, and was a collaborative effort with the industrial partner working on the design of the turbine for the EU funded SCARABEUS project. This paper was first presented at ASME Turbo Expo 2023, before being recommended for journal publication. The paper provides an details on the aerodynamic and mechanical design of a large-scale multi-stage axial turbine operating with a novel working fluid - a blend of CO<sub>2</sub> and sulphur dioxide.

**Integrated aerodynamic and mechanical design of a large-scale axial turbine operating with a supercritical carbon dioxide mixture**

*In this paper, the design of a large-scale axial turbine operating with supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO<sub>2</sub>) blended with sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is presented considering aerodynamic and mechanical design aspects as well as the integration of the whole turbine assembly. The turbine shaft power is 130 MW, designed for a 100 MW<sub>e</sub> concentrated-solar power plant with turbine inlet conditions of 239.1 bar and 700 °C⁠, total-to-static pressure ratio of 2.94, and mass-flow rate of 822 kg/s. The aerodynamic flow path, obtained in a previous study, is first summarized before the aerodynamic performance of the turbine is evaluated using both steady-state and unsteady three-dimensional numerical models. Whole-annulus unsteady simulations are performed for the last turbine stage and the exhaust section to assess the unsteady loads on the rotor due to downstream pressure field distortion and to assess the aerodynamic losses within the diffuser and exhaust section. The potential low engine order excitation at the last rotor stage natural frequency modes due to downstream pressure distortion is assessed. The design of the turbine assembly is constrained by current manufacturing capabilities and the properties of the proposed working fluid. High-level flow-path design parameters, such as pitch diameter and number of stages, are established considering a trade-off between weight and footprint, turbine efficiency, and rotordynamics. Rotordynamic stability is assessed considering the high fluid density and related cross coupling effects. Finally, shaft end sizing, cooling system design, and the integration of dry gas seals are discussed.*
