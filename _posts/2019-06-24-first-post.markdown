Well this is exciting - my personal research website is now live.

If you are reading this, then let me take this opportunity to welcome you to my site. As stated on my homepage, the purpose of this site is to act as a platform for me to let you all know what I'm doing within my research, whilst serving as a place for some reflection about how it fits into the wider society. I also hope that it will serve as a place to document my own journey through the landscape of academia.

Well, I think that's enough of an introduction for now, but watch this space for regular updates. Please feel free to take a look around to get a bit more of an idea about my background, my research interests and my research publications to date.
