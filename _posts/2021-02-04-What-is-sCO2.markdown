The end of 2020 brought with it a new publication - [a review paper discussing the current state-of-the-art in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) technologies for power generation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.116447). But to the uninitiated, what is a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> power system? Let?s see if we can cover some basics.

Within the ORC-101 section, we have already introduced the topic of a [thermal power system]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _orc101/post1_thermodynamic-cycle.markdown %}) and a [working fluid]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _orc101/post2_fluids.markdown %}). We have also discussed that common power systems operate with air or water, or possibly an organic fluid, as their working fluid. So, with that in mind, the first thing that we can note is that a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> power system is simply a thermal power system that operates with CO<sub>2</sub> as its working fluid.

But what does the term *supercritical* mean? Well, that is a little bit harder to explain.

The textbook definition of a supercritical fluid is a fluid that is at a temperature and pressure that is greater than the temperature and pressure at its critical point, at which point there is no distinction between liquid and vapour phases ? but what does that actually mean?

Let?s start by considering water. We know that under atmospheric pressure water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. Moreover, boiling is the process in which water transitions from being in a liquid state (water) to a vapour state (steam), and to obtain that transition a certain amount of energy needs to be added in order to break the bonds that hold the water molecules together and turn it into a steam.

Well, if you were to now put that water in a closed vessel and subject it to a pressure that is double atmospheric pressure, the boiling temperature would increase to around 120 degrees Celsius. And if I was to increase the pressure to 50 times atmospheric pressure, the boiling temperature would increase to around 265 degrees Celsius. But more importantly, as I increase the pressure, the amount of energy required to transition from liquid to vapour reduces.

*Heating of water at different pressures, with each coloured line representing a different pressure. At a pressure of 1 atmosphere (red line) water is first heated from 0 degrees Celsius up to 100 degrees Celsius. A certain amount of enthalpy (essentially energy) is required to transition into vapour as shown by the horizontal red line, after which heating of the vapour continues. At a pressure of 50 atmosphere, the amount of energy required to boil the water is reduced, and at 275 atmosphere the pressure is higher than the critical point and there is distinction between liquid and vapour phases.*
