Last Autumn it was great to welcome my first PhD student at the University of Sussex! A few month's late, but let me introduce you to Charlie Westpfel who will be working with me to develop a new test rig to explore the wet-to-dry expansion of organic fluids. Fun times ahead! But for now, here's an introduction from Charlie himself. 

*I completed my Master’s in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Sussex in 2023 during which I discovered a proclivity for thermodynamic power cycles, heat transfer and engineering design. My curiosity, interests and encouragement from mentors led me down the path to pursue a PhD which is where I currently reside.*

*During the initial stages of my Master’s degree, I found enlightenment in topics pertaining to thermodynamics and thermal power cycles with a particular interest in the experimental procedures which help validate theory. This laid a foundation on which I would establish a fascination for the conversion of energy into useful forms and the methods through which we can optimise this. The Rankine cycle was a particular interest of mine due to the array of scales and operating conditions and the heat sources for which they are suitable.*

*I was first able to explore the practical applications of Rankine cycles during the summer of 2021 when I was offered a short-term placement position at Dungeness nuclear power station. Through this I was able to observe the sheer magnitude on which power can be generated and the complexities which are entangled in such a process. My position allowed me to explore the possibilities and implications of the different systems and is an area of interest I carry through my current research.*

*In 2022-2023 I was elected as the lead of the Sussex rocketry team where I enjoyed the management and organisation of a complex project, as well as the application of fluid dynamics and engineering design which contribute to the creation of a mid-powered rocket. My interest in research and the management of such a project led me to express and question the possibilities of a PhD. I was later approached by my then supervisor who encouraged, and recommended, I pursue a PhD position.* 

*This is when I was first introduced to Dr Martin White as we began talks over a proposed PhD topic. The topic of research is the improvement of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) performance through two-phase expansion with application to waste heat recovery. The alignment of this topic with my interests, goals and experiences was inconceivable and a position I sought with great enthusiasm. Thankfully Martin saw my potential for the proposed research topic, and I was awarded a funded studentship with the University of Sussex. I continued my studies where I graduated with a first-class Master’s in Mechanical Engineering. I was also awarded the IMechE Frederic Barnes Waldren “Best Student” Award, IMechE Institution Best Student Award, and the University of Sussex Brian Roberts Prize for Best MEng Project.*

*As of September 2023, I have begun my PhD in the Thermo-Fluid Mechanics Research Centre at Sussex. With the supervision and support of Martin I aim to experimentally validate two-phase expansion as a means of improving ORC performance for waste heat recovery applications. Current studies demonstrate an improved power output through expanding from a mixture, however proven expander technologies that can expand effectively without damage are in demand. My research will seek to commission an experimental test facility in which a controlled two-phase flow can be expanded through a nozzle. Through this we hope to demonstrate that pure vapour flow, or a significant increase in vapour quality, can be achieved at the nozzle outlet.*

*My journey through academia has been enlightening and thrilling and I aim to continue this through my PhD and the pursuit of more knowledge.*
