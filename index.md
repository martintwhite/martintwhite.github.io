Welcome! The purpose of this site is to act as a platform to let you all know what I'm doing both within my research and in my day-to-day life as a researcher. My hope is that this site will serve as a place for some reflection about my own research, and  a place to document my own journey through the landscape of academia with the hope that others might find this interesting, helpful or even inspiring.

Watch this space for regular updates and please feel free to take a look around the site to get a bit more of an idea about my background, my research interests and my research publications to date. Also take a look at the ORC-101 section, which is focussed on covering some of the key scientific principles behind by research in an approachable way.
