## Current PhD students

# Abdelrahman Abdeldayem (co-supervisor, 2020-Present)
<div id="twocol_container">
    <div id="DivB">
	<p>Abdelrahman is a PhD student and graduate teaching assistant at the School of Science and Technology, City, University of London. He holds MSc and BSc degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Alexandria University, Egypt. Abdelrahman's PhD research is focused on numerical simulation and loss investigation of large-scale supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> axial turbines. His findings have improved the understanding of the aerodynamic performance of novel turbines operating with CO<sub>2</sub>-based mixtures and verified the applicability of the existing mean-line loss models at both design and off-design operating conditions.</p>

## Past PhD students

# Dr Salma Salah (co-supervisor, 2019-2023)
<div id="twocol_container">
    <div id="DivB">
	<p>Salma is currently a lecturer at the British University in Egypt (BUE). She obtained her PhD in Mechanical Engineering from City, University of London, along with an MSc degree from Cairo University and a BSc degree from the British University in Egypt. During her doctoral studies, Salma dedicated almost four years to working on the design and analysis of supercritical carbon-dioxide axial turbines. Her research primarily focused on developing and optimising design tools for a 100 MW scale sCO<sub>2</sub> multi-stage axial turbine. This work contributed to a deeper understanding of the main design features of turbines operating with CO<sub>2</sub> mixtures. Furthermore, her work evaluated the capability of existing mean-line loss models in predicting the performance of turbines operating with CO<sub>2</sub> mixtures.</p>
