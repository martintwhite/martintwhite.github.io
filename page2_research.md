My main research focus is on the development of future energy systems for power generation from low- and medium-temperature heat sources, which includes solar, biomass, geothermal and waste heat. Primarily this includes research into organic Rankine cycle and supercritical carbon dioxide power systems, with a specific focus on the four areas outlined below.
